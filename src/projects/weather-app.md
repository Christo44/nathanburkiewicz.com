Weather app project for Free Code Camp.

The app uses the HTML5 geolocation api to determine users location, the OpenWeatherMap api for weather data and React for the view layer.

Styling done with Skeleton.css.

The Raleway font is used for all typography. [Owfont](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/), created by Deniz Fuchidzhiev, is used for the weather icons.
