Six unique templates for the iOS app version of Yes magazine made for the [TypeEngine](http://typeengine.net/) publishing platform.

A template was made for each section of the magazine and was designed to mimic, as much as possible, the styles of the print version.

A custom HTML5 audio player, based on MediaElement.js, was made for use in the audio scripts.

Sass (Bourbon and Neat) was used to style the templates.
